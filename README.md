# :cloud: Cloud Native Bootcamp :cloud:

This is the repository for the [Cloudskills](https://cloudskills.io/) Cloud Native DevOps Bootcamp projects. Here you'll find my journey, the projects I'm working on, notes on the lectures, and other additional resources.

I'll divide this repo in folders named weeks. Under each week, I'll post that week's project, and some extra stuff related to the topics covered. The **Notes** file is where I'll keep the notes on the lecture.

## Week 1: DevOps Fundamental Skills

*February 10th*

For this first week, Michael Levan gives us an introduction to DevOps, what it is, its role and importance for the business.

In the lecture, Michael mentions 3 books that are a must read: [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/), [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-devops-handbook/), and [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/). My plan is to write summaries of these 3 books, and post them under the **Books** folder.
